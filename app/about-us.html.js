        <p><strong>Cancer Chat Canada Taking a Pause</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Cancer Chat has been providing free and professional-led online support groups for Canadians affected by cancer, including patients, survivors and family members for over 15 years. The program, originally named Cancer Chat Canada was developed and hosted by BC Cancer, and was funded by the Canadian Partnership against Cancer (CPAC) up until 2015. In 2016, CPAC continued to provide funding to help the program transition to de Souza Institute at University Health Network in Ontario. Now called Cancer Chat at de Souza Institute (or simply Cancer Chat). de Souza Institute has leveraged its online education platform and collaborated with six provinces which provided in-kind contribution of counsellors to continue to deliver free professional-led online support groups to Canadians.

            Since 2015, Cancer Chat supported on average 150 patients and families living with cancer every year.  During the COVID pandemic, Cancer Chat doubled the number of enrollment to 250/year.  The program also received a grant from the Canadian Internet Registration Authority from 2018 to 2019 to deliver groups focusing on body image and sexual health among cancer survivors and another grant from the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research from 2019-2021 on using artificial intelligence to improve distress management in online groups.

            As we enter a new year in 2022, we are pleased to witness the giant leap forward in the availability of online access to care and support in the past two years as a result of coping with a pandemic. Organizations such as Canadian Cancer Society, Wellspring,  Ovarian Cancer Canada,  Colorectal Cancer Canada, and many other disease associations and organizations are now offering online resources, communities and support. Cancer Chat Canada was a pioneer in many ways and we are happy that it has achieved its vision of making online support groups available widely to patients and families in time of need.

            Moving forward, Cancer Chat will no longer offer online support groups on the Cancerchat platform and we will be closing our website to new registrations. However, we will continue to have historical information and resources available and will direct people looking for support groups to other community resources available to them.

            We want to thank all of our program partners and sponsors, our committed professional facilitators across Canada, and especially patients and families who contributed to the success of Cancerchat online support groups over the years.
